- Location of Motor system
*what motor system controls the limbs? what controls the trunk?*
*what is the difference between grey matter and white matter in the spinal cord?*
*do somatosensory neurons enter the spinal cord dorsally or ventrally? what about motor neurons?*



- Upper and Lower Motor Neurons
*what are striate muscles?*
*why do LMNs synapse to striate muscles?*
*whats the diff between UMN & LMN? How are they related?*
*do UMN receive signals AND send signals? what about LMNs?*
*what happens if a LMN is lesioned?*

- Lower Motor Neuron Syndrome
*what are symptoms of LMN syndrome?*
*how are there fibrillations in LMN syndrome if the nerve is lesioned and damaged, a synapse shouldn't be possible since a pathway for its transmission does not exist right?*

- The Lateral Motor System
*what is the main tract UMNs run through to access LMNs in the Lateral Motor System?*
*what happens if there is a lesion of a vertebrae in the Lateral Motor System? Where/what is the damage?*
*what is the diff between ipsilateral & contralateral?*
*what type of information do the fibers in the Lateral Corticospinal Tract transmit?*

- The Medial Motor System
*is the Corticospinal Tract which goes to the Lateral Motor System the same tract that goes to the Medial Motor System?*
*what is the name of the main tract UMNs run through to access the Medial Motor System?*
*what other two pathways do UMNs utilize to access the Medial Motor System?*
*what type of information do the fibers in the Medial Corticospinal Tract transmit?*



- Somatosensory
*what tracts ascend & what tracts decend? how are they different?*
*how are UMNs and LMNs different than proprioceptive receptors?*
*list the 3 ascending tracts and their function*
*where is the somatosensory cortex?*
*where do the ascending tracts acend to?*

- Dorsal Column
*what are the two parts of the Dorsal Column?*
*what does proprioceptive mean?*
*where does the dorsal column ascend to?*
*where do gracile fasciculus fibers ascend from in the body?*
*where do cuneate fasciculus fibers ascend from in the body?*
*what does cuneate fasciculus mean?*

- SpinoCerebellar Tracts
*why does this tract travel to the cerebellum, yet the other two tracts travel to the somatosensory cortex?*
*is the cerebellum contralateral or ipsilateral?*

- Anterolateral System
*what does decussate mean?*
*is the somatosensory cortex contralateral or ipsilateral?*
*where does the tract travel to?*
