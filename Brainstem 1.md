- Landmarks
*what are the levels of the brainstem?*
*what are the junctions in the brainstem?*
*why are there junctions in the brainstem?*

- Functions
*what is the function of the midbrain? what about the pons? what about the medulla?*

- Details of the brainstem
*why are the tracts separated in the medulla?*
*why are the tracts less visible in the decussation of pyramids? what happens to those neurons?(contralateral neurons)*
